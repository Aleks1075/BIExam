## Stage 1: Problem Definition

### 1. Brainstorming and Idea Collection
I am addressing the domain of sports analytics, specifically within football (soccer). The Premier League is one of the most popular football leagues globally, and there's a significant interest in predicting team performances for various reasons:
- Fan engagement
- Betting
- Team strategy planning, etc.

### 2. Problem Definition

**Context:** 
The realm of football analytics, focusing on the English Premier League. The league's unpredictable nature, with a lot of data available, makes it an exciting area for data-driven insights.

**Purpose:** 
To apply the power of BI in predicting Premier League team performances, thereby providing stakeholders with actionable insights based on data.

**Research Questions:** 
- Can we predict the end-of-season position of Premier League teams based on historical data and player transfers?
- How can we categorize teams' performances throughout the season using classification models?
- Which teams have historically shown similar patterns in performance and metrics, and can we cluster them together?

**Challenge Addressed:** 
Predicting the performance and standing position of Premier League teams based on historical data, player transfer information, and other relevant metrics.

**Importance of Research Goal:** 
The outcome of the league standing, is influenced by numerous factors. Understanding these dynamics can provide insights for team managers, players, and fans. It can have potential applications in areas like sports betting and fantasy league selections.

**Expected Solution:** 
A BI solution that uses machine learning models to offer predictions on:
- The end-of-season position of teams.
- The team's performance category throughout the season.
- Clusters of teams that are similar in terms of performance and metrics.

**Impact and Beneficiary Users:** 
The solution can significantly benefit football analysts, team managers, and stakeholders by offering data-backed predictions and insights. Fans and individuals in fantasy leagues or sports betting can also utilize the predictions.
